## Server

### Server Setup

##### Installed in your system.

##### Installed in your `package.json` file.

Install server dependencies by running.

```bash
   cd <PROJECT_FOLDER>/server
   npm install
```

This folder contains your mock/prototype backend to handle RESTful requests when storing your bookmarks. All you need to do is have a JSON file as sample data in your root folder. For this project we use `db.json` to mock our storage.
